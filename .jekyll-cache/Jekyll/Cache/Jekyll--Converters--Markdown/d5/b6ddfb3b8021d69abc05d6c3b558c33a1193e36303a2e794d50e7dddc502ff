I"£<p>This is a collection of posters I created for musical artists for Milan Records. Emilie Simoneâ€™s concert at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles and advertisment for the Mint Chicks debut US album.</p>

<p>Emilie Simon wanted an octopus in the background and thought that was a really fun and unusual idea. She was enthusiastic when seeing what I created and I enjoyed how they blended with her tentacle-like hair.</p>
