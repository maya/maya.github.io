I"ƒ<p>This is a book I made for my Typography class using Dante Infernoâ€™s text. To make the book, we had various restrictions from font size, style, color that were removed each week. I wanted to mirror motifs like the nine circles of hell and used text to create flames, rings, gates and more.</p>

<p>The first part is the process book, the second part uses photography from my travels abroad in Italy. I made the book with Japanese Stab Book Binding in purple and silver string.</p>
