I"!<p>I had the privilege to design this poster for the Samburu Project, a non-profit organization that provides easy access to clean, safe drinking water to communities throughout the Samburu District of Kenya.</p>

<p>This is a community where women and children walk up to 12 miles every day in search of water. Often, this water is contaminated. With clean water, it will become possible to impact other aspects of community life including education, healthcare, income generation and womenÂ´s empowerment. With water, development happens.</p>
