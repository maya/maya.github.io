I"›<p>###Background / Problem:</p>

<p>During city residency in February a number of fellowship teams worked together to deploy simple, fun applications that showed the crazy winter weather going on in their cities. Many teams focused on whether or not it was snowing. We were in Texas.</p>

<p>###Research:</p>

<p>Our research for this application was pretty simple: we talked to our city partner about the weather rock lore and heard a lot of conversations from people around town talking about the crazy weather.</p>

<p>###Solution:</p>

<p>Our application is a reflection of a long-running joke popular with the locals called the weather rock. If you want to know the temperature, look at the weather rock. If the rock is swinging, it is windy. If the rock is warm, it is hot outside. This was a fun project that pokes fun at the serious business of meteorology in a very San Antonio way that citizens can laugh at.</p>
