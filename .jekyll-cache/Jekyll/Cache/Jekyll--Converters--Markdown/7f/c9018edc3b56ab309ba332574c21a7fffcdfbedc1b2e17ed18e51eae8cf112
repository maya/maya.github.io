<p>I focused on continually improving the tool by:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Implementing the appâ€™s landing page refresh to make sure any testing site interested in SimpleReport had all the necessary info to sign up</li>
  <li>Developing a new patient experience feature for the product, allowing patients to complete their own pre-screening questions, thereby providing improved privacy for patients and more complete data for health departments</li>
  <li>Building out the appâ€™s mobile experience</li>
  <li>Redesigning the account creation, login, and password reset experience to massively speed up the onboarding process</li>
  <li>Building a React component library in Storybook and visual regression tooling with Chromatic for a COVID test reporting app with the CDC.</li>
</ul>
