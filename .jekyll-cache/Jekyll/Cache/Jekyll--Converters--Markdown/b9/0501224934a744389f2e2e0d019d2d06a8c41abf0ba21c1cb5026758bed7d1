I"þ<p>Mobile Orchestra is a way to visualize bikers in Critical Mass. We forked Jono Brandelâ€™s <a href="http://patatap.com">Patatap</a> and created music loops from it that are associated with a person. As each person enters the bike group, a piece of their music loop gets played, as they leave, it gets removed. This creates a live, sonic representation of music. I also created the beats.</p>
