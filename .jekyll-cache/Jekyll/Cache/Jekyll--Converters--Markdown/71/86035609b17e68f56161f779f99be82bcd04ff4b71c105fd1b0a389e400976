I"<p>I had the privilege to lead the USA &amp; Brazil teams to launch a new web presence for CAIB, “Conselho de Assuntos Internacionais do Brasil,” which has enabled the organization to reach out to a global community connected to Brazil and Brazilian Issues.</p>

<p>The site is dedicated to educating, inspiring, and engaging Brazilians of all ages in international affairs and the critical global issues of the times. Collaborating with an international team of designers, writers, educators and social entrepreneurs from Los Angeles and Brazil, we were able to to bring to life a sustainable global website. By using bright colors, modern patterns, and distinctively Brazilian imagery, we were able to capture an exciting vision of the Brazilian brand.</p>
