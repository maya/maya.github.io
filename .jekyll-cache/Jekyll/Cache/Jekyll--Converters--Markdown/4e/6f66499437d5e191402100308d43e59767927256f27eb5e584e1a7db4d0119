I"*<p>This is a book I made for my Typography class using Dante Infernoâ€™s text. To make the book, we had various restrictions from font size, style, color that were removed each week. I wanted to mirror motifs like the nine circles of hell and used text to create flames, rings, gates and more.</p>
