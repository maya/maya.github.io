I"ƒ<p>I led development on a website for writer and doctor, Louise Aronson. I utilized Advanced Custom Fields, a WordPress plugin, to ensure the client has a easy and usable method of updating and adding in new content. I love this method because clients begin to feel like they <em>own</em> their website, without fear of messing it up.</p>
