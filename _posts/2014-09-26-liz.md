The Living Innovation Zone Program (LIZ) makes it possible to use public space in new and exciting ways. By enlivening public spaces with art installations, these spaces become places for people to stop, engage, and enjoy urban life.

I worked on the LIZ project with the San Francisco Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation to make a more open project curation process for LIZ's. We decided to divide the website into spaces and ideas. Spaces were existing locations a person could explore, envision their art there, and then apply for the space. Ideas were where user ideas would live and be open for the public to vote on their favorite idea. We developed a system to show when a space was available or filled so users could see if they wanted to apply or explore.
