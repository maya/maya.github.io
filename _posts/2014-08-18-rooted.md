The site was created to cultivate the ROOTED lifestyle: healthy living by eating well and staying active. 

We wanted the site to spread healthy vibes through food that is local, organic, seasonal, and “rooted” to the environment. The goal: connect people through food. The site uses a powerful content builder and advanced search capabilities to show off these delectable culinary inspirations. This paved the way for a dynamic, user-friendly, and informative website.
