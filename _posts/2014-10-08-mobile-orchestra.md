title: Mobile Orchestra
excerpt: I created Mobile Orchestra to represent with sound moving bike groups, like Critical Mass. Loops from Jono Brandel’s Patatap stream into the group as bikers enter the group.

Mobile Orchestra is a way to visualize bikers in Critical Mass. We forked Jono Brandel’s [Patatap](http://patatap.com) and created music loops from it that are associated with a person. As each person enters the bike group, a piece of their music loop gets played, as they leave, it gets removed. This creates a live, sonic representation of music. I also created the beats.
