title: U.S. Web Design System
excerpt: I led design, product, and front-end development for the U.S. Web Design System — the shared UI and style framework now used by **hundreds** of federal agency projects nationwide. My work focused on raising standards for user experience, accessibility, and consistency in government digital services.
tagline: Led front-end design and helped shape system architecture and long-term strategy as a core contributor, driving adoption across 90+ agencies and over 1 billion page views annually.

### What I did

- Designed and developed a robust set of common UI components built on a solid HTML foundation, enhanced with Sass, to ensure modular, maintainable front-end code.  
- Ensured full **[Section 508 compliance](https://www.section508.gov/)** and progressive enhancement so the system works across browsers and for all users.  
- Created documentation, style guidelines, and developer-friendly patterns to help teams adopt the system quickly and correctly.  
- Collaborated with multiple government agencies and front-end designers/developers to balance modular CSS with usability, maintainability, and consistency.  

### Outcomes & impact

- Widely adopted by dozens of federal agencies, leading to significant reductions in duplicate work and maintenance costs.  
- Improved accessibility and usability across federal websites, making digital services more inclusive.  
- Contributed to the launch of **[USWDS 2.0](https://designsystem.digital.gov/whats-new/updates/2019/04/08/uswds-2-0-release/)**, with enhancements to modularity, flexibility, and design maturity.  
- Made it easier for government design teams to hit the ground running — accelerating front-end development time and raising the baseline of public digital experience.
