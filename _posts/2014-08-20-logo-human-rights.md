There is no universally recognized logo for Human Rights. This was a global initiative to change that by creating a universal symbol for human rights. With over 15,000 submissions from more than 190 countries, the impact and outreach of the initiative exceeded all expectations.

I was lucky enough to have my design advance to the Top 100 submissions and reach up to rank 26 in the popular vote.
