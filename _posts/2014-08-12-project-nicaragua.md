Project Nicaragua advances the right to a healthy and productive life by addressing health-related disparities in and alongside Nicaragua’s poor. Comprised of Physicians, Medical Students, and Undergraduates within the US and Nicaragua, Project Nicaragua engages communities to advocate and cultivate sustainable medical and health-related projects in areas of nutrition, socioeconomic development, water quality, and education.

We created a space for all various chapters and institutions associated with the organization’s efforts to come together.
