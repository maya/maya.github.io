I Love San Antonio is a public space to talk about everything that makes San Antonio a great place to live. Residents can post their musings about the Alamo City anonymously or sign them publicly with a twitter handle. The app encourages keeping responses short, so they can be tweeted out later by people who agree with the sentiment.

The application has received over 200 contributions since we deployed it. Residents’ love letters range from simple observations (“The people here are nice!”) to deep reflections (“Family, community, stable convergence of assets and initiatives forging a brilliant future. It’s got roots that are deep”).
