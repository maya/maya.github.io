I had the privilege to work with abstract, minimalist artist (and awesome mother), Yoella Razili on catalogs for her 2014 exhibition. The most important thing I learned when designing catalogs for an artist, is to fade away and let the artwork shine. Razili has a talent for combining various materials and producing surprising pairings. I had a lot of fun pairing the work on a page that allowed for complements and surprises.

When I played percussion in a symphony, there was a saying that the drums should be *felt, not heard*. In the same way, when designing for an artist, your designs should complement and support, not be noticed. Less is certainly more.
