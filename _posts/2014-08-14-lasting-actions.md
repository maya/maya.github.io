Lasting Actions aims to provide access to technology for poor children, giving them the chance to have great futures. Currently assisting children in Ethiopia, Brazil, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic, the organizationâ€™s team and projects extend five continents.

I helped Lasting Actions bring their brand and mission to life with an experience-driven website that allows for exploration of the organizations global reach.
