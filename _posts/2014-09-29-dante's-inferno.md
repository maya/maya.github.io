This is a book I made for my Typography class using Dante Inferno's text. To make the book, we had various restrictions from font size, style, color that were removed each week. I wanted to mirror motifs like the nine circles of hell and used text to create flames, rings, gates and more.

The first part is the process book, the second part uses photography from my travels abroad in Italy. I made the book with Japanese Stab Book Binding in purple and silver string.
