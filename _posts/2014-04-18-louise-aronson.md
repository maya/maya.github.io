I led development on a website for writer and doctor, Louise Aronson. I utilized Advanced Custom Fields, a WordPress plugin, to ensure the client has a easy and usable method of updating and adding in new content. I love this method because clients begin to feel like they *own* their website, without fear of messing it up.
