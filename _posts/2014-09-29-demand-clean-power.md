A national campaign by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Robert Redford to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and promote clean energy instead. It has had hundreds of thousands of visits since launch.

I had the privilege to do the frontend development and implement animations of beautifully crafted icons which enter the screen as you scroll through the website.
