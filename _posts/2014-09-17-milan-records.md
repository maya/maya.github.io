This is a collection of posters I created for musical artists for Milan Records. Emilie Simone's concert at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles and advertisment for the Mint Chicks debut US album.

Emilie Simone wanted an octopus in the background and thought that was a really fun and unusual idea. She was enthusiastic when seeing what I created and I enjoyed how they blended with her tentacle-like hair.
