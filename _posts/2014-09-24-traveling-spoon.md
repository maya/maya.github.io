Traveling Spoon is an online marketplace that connects travelers with vetted, local and authentic food experiences — from homemade meals to cooking classes — in people’s homes around the world.

I had the privilege to work with the company to create a website that highlights the people and food experiences that people have and offers a meaningful way to enjoy meals abroad. The website unites travelers and locals to share food experiences—from homemade meals to cooking classes—that provide visitors with an opportunity to get to know a native food-culture personally while giving hosts the chance to meet people from all around the world and make an extra income. So far, Traveling Spoon offers vetted restaurant-alternatives in 14 cities in Thailand, India, and Vietnam.
