### The challenge

- The original site had inconsistent UI patterns, slow performance, and usability barriers for mobile users and those relying on assistive technologies.  
- States reported drop-off in voter registration workflows due to confusing form fields, unclear navigation, and friction in the registration flow.

### What I did

- Overhauled the front-end architecture to support modern, responsive layouts across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Streamlined the registration workflow: simplified form fields, clarified instructions, and reduced steps to completion.  
- Improved performance by optimizing asset loading, reducing page weight, and enhancing front-end code efficiency.  
- Elevated accessibility standards: ensured Section 508 and WCAG compliance, and introduced better keyboard navigation.  
- Collaborated with designers, content strategists, and state stakeholders to ensure the experience was clear, inclusive, and compliant.

### Impact

- **Record-breaking voter registrations** were reported in several states after the relaunch.  
- Mobile access and successful form completions significantly increased.  
- The site became a more trusted, usable, and accessible destination for civic participation.

### Takeaways

- Clarity and accessibility aren’t optional — they directly impact civic engagement and user trust.  
- Even small UX improvements can dramatically boost conversions.  
- Working across disciplines — front-end, design, policy — is key to building inclusive, high-impact government services.
