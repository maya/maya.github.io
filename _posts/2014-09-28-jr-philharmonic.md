I had the privilege to design the poster for the Jr. Philharmonic Orchestra of California 75th anniversary Diamond Jubilee concert. 

The Jr. Phil was one of the oldest young people's symphony orchestras in the United States. The orchestra was commited to changing the lives of young people via classical music. More than 10,000 musicians, ages 12 through 25, have been selected for membership in the orchestra. The symphony touched the lives of thousands of young people from diverse social, economic and ethnic backgrounds.
 
The goal of these designs was to highlight the beautiful Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, which the concert was taking place in as well as honor conductor-founder Dr. Ernst Katz, who had passed away after 72 years of conducting the orchestra. These prints were featured inside the Walt Disney Concert Hall. This was also the final concert of the Jr. Phil and was honored to perform live on percussion as well. The orchestra had a profound effect on my life and was glad to give something back.
