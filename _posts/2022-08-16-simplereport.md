title: SimpleReport
excerpt: When COVID-19 testing expanded into non-traditional settings, SimpleReport needed to be fast, usable, and trustworthy — for both health departments and patients. I worked across design, UX, and front-end tooling to make that happen.
tagline: Built a React component library that enabled 25+ states to report COVID-19 test results, accelerating development during a national health response.

### What I did
- Refreshed the landing page to clearly communicate what SimpleReport offers, making it easier for testing sites to understand and sign up.  
- Improved the mobile user interface to ensure good usability on mobile devices.  
- Redesigned onboarding flows — account creation, login, and password reset — dramatically reducing friction and time to first-use.  
- Built a React component library in Storybook, integrated with **visual regression testing** using Chromatic, to improve consistency and confidence in UI updates.

### Key outcomes & impact
- Onboarding time decreased, resulting in fewer abandoned registrations. 
- Patient feedback improved around clarity and privacy in pre-screening; health departments saw more complete data submission.  
- The refined mobile experience increased engagement among mobile users.  
- Developer speed and quality improved thanks to a shared component library + regression tooling — fewer UI bugs, faster iterations.
