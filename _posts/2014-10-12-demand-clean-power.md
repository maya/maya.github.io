Demand Clean Power is a national campaign by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Robert Redford to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and promote clean energy instead. It attracted hundreds of thousands of visits at launch.

By using subtle animations, we were able to bring storytelling elements to life and engage users to sign the petition rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline.
