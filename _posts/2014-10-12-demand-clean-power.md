excerpt: I led frontend development for a national campaign for the National Resource Defense Council that received hundreds of thousands of visits at launch. By using subtle animations, we were able to bring storytelling elements to life and engage users to sign the petition rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline.

Demand Clean Power is a national campaign by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Robert Redford to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone XL pipeline and promote clean energy instead. It attracted hundreds of thousands of visits at launch.

I had the privilege to do the frontend development and implement animations of beautifully crafted icons which enter the screen as you scroll through the website.
