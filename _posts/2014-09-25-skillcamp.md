Skillcamp is a learning space that helps navigate you through civic technology training. 

With my team, I created a website that provides education resources around civic technology. I did the frontend development of the site as well as worked with designers and illustrators to create a fun and friendly look and feel. I really enjoyed the campy look and coming up with the navigation that acts as live sign-posts. Going through the lesson, is as easy and friendly as creating a new lesson.

Team members: Alex Tran, Molly McLeod, Dan Getelman, Drew Wilson
