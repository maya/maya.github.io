Skillcamp is a learning space that helps navigate you through civic technology training. 

The goal was to create a website that you could create and provide education resources around civic technology. I did the frontend development of the site as well as worked with designers and illustrators to create a fun and friendly look and feel. I really enjoyed the campy look and coming up with the navigation that act as live sign-posts. I wanted to make sure that going through the lesson would be as easy and friendly as creating a new lesson.

I look forward to moving this from a prototype to a functioning community.
