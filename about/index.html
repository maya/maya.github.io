      <p class="big-text">Design and code are the two mediums I use. I believe design should make you think more clearly, feel more deeply, and behave more responsibly. And I like to apply this to meaningful projects.</p>
      
      <p>I’ve worked on projects across the globe in the US, Australia, India, and Brazil. I’ve designed and developed websites for startups, the healthcare industry, and non-profit organizations.</p>
      
      <p>I’m passionate about making the world a better place. For example, I’ve worked on projects that promote clean energy, alleviate hunger for homeless people, bring clean drinking water to Kenya, invigorate public spaces in San Francisco, allow youth to flourish through classical music, and many more.</p>
      
      <p>This year, I’ve been advocating for design in the civic space as a fellow with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, where I developed a web application to renovate housing safely and efficiently with the City of San Antonio. I enjoy working through the entire creative process from concept to implementation.</p>
            
      <p>I love discovering new tools and learning new techniques, and hope to keep playing with Two.js and D3.</p>
