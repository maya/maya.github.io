      <p class="big-text">Design and code are the two mediums I use today. I believe design should make you think more clearly, feel more deeply, and behave more responsibly. And I like to apply this to meaningful projects.</p>
      
      <p>I’ve worked on projects across the globe in the US, Australia, India, and Brazil. I’ve designed and developed websites for startups, medical companies, and non-profit organizations.</p>
      
      <p>I’m passionate about making the world a better place. For example, I’ve contributed to projects that promote clean energy, alleviate hunger for homeless people, bring clean drinking water to Kenya, bring medicine to hospitals in Nicaragua, create community for people with head injuries, allow youth to flourish with classical music, and many more.</p>
      
      <p>This year, I’ve been advocating for design in the civic space as a fellow with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, where I developed a web application with the City of San Antonio. I enjoy working through the entire creative process from concept to implementation.</p>
      
      <p>The web is a wonderful medium to share and collaborate. Websites can communicate like humans do, with empathy for the person using it.</p>
      
      <p>I love discovering new tools and learning new techniques, and hope to keep playing with Two.js and D3.</p>
